=====================================================================

**VTP** is a Python package that contains functions for processing
vehicle telematics data and applying deterministic rules in order to
characterize a vehicle's activity.

Main Features
-------------
    - standardize telematics data files containing time-location data
    to equal-time-interval tables.
    - assign vehicle states based on fleet vehicle activities
    - collect variables on the behavior of fleet vehicles in order to
    cluster vehicle-day observations into like duty cycles.
