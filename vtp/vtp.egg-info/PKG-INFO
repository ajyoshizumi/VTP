**Author:** Alexander Yoshizumi

## vtp - a package for (v)ehicle (t)elamatics (p)rocessing in Python.
=====================================================================

**VTP** is a Python package that contains functions for processing
vehicle telematics data and characterizing the driving activity of a
vehicle.

Main Features
-------------
    - standardize telematics data files containing time-location data
    to equal-time-interval tables.
    - assign vehicle states based on fleet vehicle activities
    - collect variables on the behavior of fleet vehicles in order to
    cluster vehicle-day observations into like duty cycles.
